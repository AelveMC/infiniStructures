# infiniStructures
Adds two dimensions where structures spawn very often.

Each dimension requires its own portal type. Each portal is in the traditional nether portal shape (corners optional) filled with glass panes.
- "infiniworld" requires Diamond Blocks.
- "infininether" requires Netherite Blocks.
