# infiniStructures for Minecraft 1.16
Adds two dimensions where structures spawn very often.
These are supposed to be accessed as late-game objecives, and complements my other survival datapack.

Warning: These features are still experimental.

Each dimension requires its own portal type. Each portal is in the traditional nether portal shape (corners optional) filled with glass panes.
- "infiniworld" requires Diamond Blocks.
- "infininether" requires Netherite Blocks.
