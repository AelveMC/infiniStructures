# infiniStructures for Minecraft 1.16
Adds two dimensions where structures spawn very often.
These are supposed to be accessed as late-game objecives, and complements my other survival datapack.

Warning: Custom dimensions are still experimental. This datapack may break at any time.

Each dimension requires its own portal type. Each portal is in the traditional nether portal shape (corners optional) filled with glass panes. Glass panes can be of any colour.
- "infiniworld" requires Diamond Blocks.
- "infininether" requires Netherite Blocks.

Unlike normal nether portals, you will always be teleporting to 0,0 in the new dimensions. To return to the overworld you must go back through the end portal located at 0,0 and travel through the end. It is advised that the Enderdragon be killed beforehand.
